## Add a New Language

if you want to have in another language you just have to copy `locales>en.json` and rename the file then translate to your favorite language:

Just enter the [language/locale tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) of the files to use (e.g.: `fr.json` for French, `zh.json` for Chinese, `ja.json` for Japanese)
